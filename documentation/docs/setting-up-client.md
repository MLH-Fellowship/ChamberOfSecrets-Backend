title: Contribution Guide- Client 
---
---

In this guide, we will have a look at how you can get started with contributing to the Chamber of Secrets client-side web application. The client-side application for CoS has been built using **React**, and communicates to the backend server using **Axios**.

## Setting Up Local Environment
---

### Requirements:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 12.13.0 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use nvm for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed.

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) which comes pre-bundled with Node.js. 

### Instructions for CoS Client:

Assuming that you have Node already set up on your development environment, follow these steps to install the dependencies and set up the local development environment:

1. Install project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Starting the local development client-side application (assuming the server is running in the background):
```bash
npm start
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and get the application running on your system.


## Contributing to Chamber of Secrets:
---

In order to contribute to the project, make sure you follow the below mentioned guidelines:

1. To suggest a bug fix/improvement/feature etc., first create an issue. Discuss the issue with the CoS project managers and get the issue assigned to yourself.

2. Once assigned, you can start working on the project. Fork and clone the repository and follow the local development guide to set up your local development environment. 

3. Once the issue is fixed, create a PR to the upstream repository's staging branch. Wait and hear back from the project managers on their response. Once your build is tested and approved, the PR will get merged. If any changes are required, you can continue coordinating with the project managers and work on the requirements.
